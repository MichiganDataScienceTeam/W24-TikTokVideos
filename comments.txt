Medical professionals: what's a fact about human health you think everyone should know?
Comment: #1
Sleeping less than 5 hours a day increases risk of heart disease by 75%  and shortens your lifespan. It also increases risk of alzheimer’s disease & dementia in general. So sleep well lads

Paramedic. 

The things that can kill you and the things you can survive constantly amaze me.  I've seen people survive a bullet through the head and walk into my fire station after they recovered.  I saw a guy that shot himself in the chest and head and was able to shake it off and manage to get the gun and take a third shot to finish the job.  I've seen people survive crazy amounts of trauma in car wrecks.  I survived getting shot with buckshot, I saw a guy shot in the neck with a shotgun and every pellet missed anything vital.


I've also seen people die from an injury that penetrated less than an inch into someone's arm.  Death from falling backwards and hitting their head.  From a single punch, from a bullet that hit them in the butt and penetrated about an inch according to the xray.  And don't forget that a lethal heart attack or stroke is caused by a piece of plaque around the size of a pencil point.  People have an aneurysm in their head right now and don't know it. 

The line between alive and dead is unimaginably thin.

Strength training is so important for both men *and* women.

It doesn't matter how you do it, staying strong across middle and old age is immense beneficial. Physically and mentally.

Most people don’t die the way they want to. Talk to your parents and grandparents about what they would want at the end of their life. Sit down with them and make an Advanced Directive. Keep a copy. Give a copy to their doctors. There is a big difference between a “good” death and a “bad” death and often that difference could be bridged just by knowing what someone wants ahead of time.


Things to know:

- Would you ever want to be intubated? (Have a tube down your throat for a machine to breathe for you, you are usually sedated and unconscious.) what if you aren’t able to breathe on your own after a few weeks with the tube? Would you want it removed, or to stay on it indefinitely?

- Would you ever want to be shocked or have chest compressions that will probably break your ribs if your heart stopped or wasn’t working? Or would you prefer to die naturally if your heart stopped? 

- If you couldn’t eat for yourself, would you want a tube to feed you? Would you want to try that for a short period (1-2 weeks) to allow for recovery and remove it if you weren’t able to eat or communicate by then?

- If you became severely ill and it looked like you would never recover to communicate with is meaningfully, would you want to focus on comfort and quality of life instead of amount of time you are alive?

- Would you ever want an amputation?

- Do you have any plans for your body if you were to die?

[Serious]Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that the time of peace in Europe is over, that we are now living in pre-war times. Europeans of reddit, what are your thought on this speech? Is Europe really on the brink of war?

Both World Wars didn’t start out of the blue, all at once. In both cases there were smaller wars here and there with the temperature in international politics rising and clear rifts between the major powers coming up. We’re seeing a similar pattern now

Ukraine is in Europe. There is already war in Europe.

It's already started, we're just waiting for escalation.

Yeah, looks like it. Tough economic times, populism, nationalism, America on the retreat, Russia with a dying expansionist leader, Gulf states overflowing with money, Middle East a hot mess, an actual hot war in Europe right now. All signs point to war in the east.

What is the most important lesson we learned from the pandemic?
Comment: #1
That it wouldn’t take much for civilised people to turn on each other.
-----------------------------------
Comment: #2
That a very limited number of people have the ability to even consider they might be wrong

I learned that I put my career ahead of my kids. Pre-pandemic the kids were in school & after school care until my husband picked them up. I was getting home around 8:30/9. Quarantine was the most time I had spent with them since they were toddlers. I cried when they went back to school and quit my job so I would be home more. The pandemic taught me that family is more important. It’s really unfortunate that 4 years later, a 2 income household is now the only way to afford both living expenses & groceries.
