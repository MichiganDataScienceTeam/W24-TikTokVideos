00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,030
My wife had plastic surgery recently. We had discussed

2
00:00:04,062 --> 00:00:07,062
it, and I was against it. It was not my decision,

3
00:00:07,158 --> 00:00:11,038
and ultimately I had no say. She looks weird now.

4
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:15,014
She had the fat sucked out of her face, lip fillers,

5
00:00:15,134 --> 00:00:18,254
a neck lift. Other stuff I don't really get.

6
00:00:18,414 --> 00:00:22,294
She gives me uncanny Valley vibes now. It freaks me

7
00:00:22,334 --> 00:00:25,814
out. She is fully healed now, and she wants us to go back to

8
00:00:25,854 --> 00:00:29,494
normal. Like me initiating sex. I have

9
00:00:29,534 --> 00:00:32,990
done so, but not as much as I used to. And when

10
00:00:33,022 --> 00:00:36,074
I do, I try and make sure there is very little light.

11
00:00:36,614 --> 00:00:40,434
It's been a few months and I kind of dread having to look at her.

12
00:00:40,814 --> 00:00:44,806
Obviously, she has noticed. She has been bugging me to tell her

13
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:48,926
what's up. I've tried telling her I'm just tired from work or

14
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:52,110
that I'm run down, really, anything except for the

15
00:00:52,142 --> 00:00:56,224
truth. She broke down and asked me if I was having an affair.

16
00:00:56,724 --> 00:01:00,340
I said that I wasn't. She asked to look at my phone.

17
00:01:00,492 --> 00:01:04,388
I unlocked it for her and handed it over. I wasn't worried

18
00:01:04,436 --> 00:01:07,664
about her finding anything because there is nothing to find.

19
00:01:08,404 --> 00:01:12,492
She spent an hour looking through it and found nothing. She asked

20
00:01:12,548 --> 00:01:16,180
me to explain why I changed. I tried explaining that.

21
00:01:16,212 --> 00:01:19,562
I just wasn't that interested right now. Nothing I said

22
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:23,234
was good enough for her. She kept digging. I finally

23
00:01:23,274 --> 00:01:26,634
told the truth. I wasn't harsh or brutally honest.

24
00:01:26,714 --> 00:01:30,094
I just told her that her new face wasn't something I found

25
00:01:30,714 --> 00:01:34,626
attractive and that I was turned off. She asked if that's why I

26
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,994
turn off all the lights now. I said yes.

27
00:01:38,154 --> 00:01:41,618
She started crying and said that she needed time alone.

28
00:01:41,786 --> 00:01:45,710
She went to stay with her sister. I have been called every name

29
00:01:45,742 --> 00:01:49,366
in the book since this happened. Her sister said I'm a

30
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:52,274
piece of shit for insulting my wife's looks.

31
00:01:52,694 --> 00:01:55,918
Her friends all think I'm the asshole. I tried

32
00:01:55,966 --> 00:01:59,414
not to say anything. I can't force myself to find

33
00:01:59,454 --> 00:02:02,862
her attractive. I still love her, but her face is just

34
00:02:02,918 --> 00:02:06,422
weird now. She looks like the blue alien from the fifth

35
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:06,654
element.
