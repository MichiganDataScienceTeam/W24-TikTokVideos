00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,030
My wife had plastic surgery recently. We had discussed

2
00:00:04,062 --> 00:00:07,982
it, and I was against it. It was not my decision, and ultimately

3
00:00:08,038 --> 00:00:11,038
I had no say. She looks weird now.

4
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:13,670
She had the fat sucked out of her face,

5
00:00:13,862 --> 00:00:17,622
lip fillers, a neck lift. Other stuff I don't really

6
00:00:17,678 --> 00:00:21,246
get. She gives me uncanny Valley vibes now.

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,062
It freaks me out. She is fully healed now, and she wants us

8
00:00:25,078 --> 00:00:28,910
to go back to normal. Like me initiating sex.

9
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:32,114
I have done so, but not as much as I used to.

10
00:00:32,454 --> 00:00:36,074
And when I do, I try and make sure there is very little light.

11
00:00:36,614 --> 00:00:40,434
It's been a few months and I kind of dread having to look at her.

12
00:00:40,814 --> 00:00:44,630
Obviously, she has noticed. She has been bugging me to tell

13
00:00:44,662 --> 00:00:48,526
her what's up. I've tried telling her I'm just tired from work

14
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,750
or that I'm run down, really, anything except

15
00:00:51,782 --> 00:00:55,556
for the truth. She broke down and asked me if I was having an

16
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,156
affair. I said that I wasn't. She asked to

17
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,420
look at my phone. I unlocked it for her and handed

18
00:01:02,452 --> 00:01:06,092
it over. I wasn't worried about her finding anything because

19
00:01:06,148 --> 00:01:09,300
there is nothing to find. She spent an

20
00:01:09,332 --> 00:01:12,692
hour looking through it and found nothing. She asked me

21
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:16,180
to explain why I changed. I tried explaining that.

22
00:01:16,212 --> 00:01:19,562
I just wasn't that interested right now. Nothing I said

23
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:23,234
was good enough for her. She kept digging. I finally

24
00:01:23,274 --> 00:01:27,098
told the truth. I wasn't harsh or brutally honest. I just

25
00:01:27,146 --> 00:01:31,394
told her that her new face wasn't something I found attractive

26
00:01:31,434 --> 00:01:34,858
and that I was turned off. She asked if that's why I turn

27
00:01:34,906 --> 00:01:37,994
off all the lights now. I said yes.

28
00:01:38,154 --> 00:01:41,618
She started crying and said that she needed time alone.

29
00:01:41,786 --> 00:01:45,054
She went to stay with her sister. I have been called

30
00:01:45,134 --> 00:01:47,790
every name in the book since this happened.

31
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:51,494
Her sister said I'm a piece of shit for insulting my wife's

32
00:01:51,534 --> 00:01:55,190
looks. Her friends all think I'm the asshole.

33
00:01:55,342 --> 00:01:59,206
I tried not to say anything. I can't force myself to

34
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:02,862
find her attractive. I still love her, but her face is just

35
00:02:02,918 --> 00:02:06,654
weird now. She looks like the blue alien from the fifth element.
