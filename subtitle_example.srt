00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,206
My wife had plastic surgery recently. We had discussed it,

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,982
and I was against it. It was not my decision, and ultimately

3
00:00:08,038 --> 00:00:11,630
I had no say. She looks weird now. She had

4
00:00:11,662 --> 00:00:15,014
the fat sucked out of her face, lip fillers,

5
00:00:15,134 --> 00:00:19,030
a neck lift. Other stuff I don't really get. She gives

6
00:00:19,062 --> 00:00:22,294
me uncanny Valley vibes now. It freaks me

7
00:00:22,334 --> 00:00:25,590
out. She is fully healed now, and she wants us to go back

8
00:00:25,622 --> 00:00:28,910
to normal. Like me initiating sex.

9
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:32,114
I have done so, but not as much as I used to.

10
00:00:32,454 --> 00:00:36,074
And when I do, I try and make sure there is very little light.

11
00:00:36,614 --> 00:00:40,434
It's been a few months and I kind of dread having to look at her.

12
00:00:40,814 --> 00:00:44,630
Obviously, she has noticed. She has been bugging me to tell

13
00:00:44,662 --> 00:00:48,526
her what's up. I've tried telling her I'm just tired from work

14
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,110
or that I'm run down, really, anything except for the

15
00:00:52,142 --> 00:00:56,224
truth. She broke down and asked me if I was having an affair.

16
00:00:56,724 --> 00:01:00,340
I said that I wasn't. She asked to look at my phone.

17
00:01:00,492 --> 00:01:03,204
I unlocked it for her and handed it over.

18
00:01:03,364 --> 00:01:07,076
I wasn't worried about her finding anything because there is nothing to

19
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,396
find. She spent an hour looking through it

20
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,844
and found nothing. She asked me to explain why I

21
00:01:13,884 --> 00:01:17,124
changed. I tried explaining that. I just wasn't that

22
00:01:17,164 --> 00:01:21,082
interested right now. Nothing I said was good enough for her.

23
00:01:21,218 --> 00:01:25,234
She kept digging. I finally told the truth. I wasn't

24
00:01:25,274 --> 00:01:28,490
harsh or brutally honest. I just told her that her new face

25
00:01:28,562 --> 00:01:31,770
wasn't something I found attractive and that

26
00:01:31,802 --> 00:01:35,090
I was turned off. She asked if that's why I turn off

27
00:01:35,122 --> 00:01:38,874
all the lights now. I said yes. She started

28
00:01:38,954 --> 00:01:42,490
crying and said that she needed time alone. She went to

29
00:01:42,522 --> 00:01:45,710
stay with her sister. I have been called every name

30
00:01:45,742 --> 00:01:48,990
in the book since this happened. Her sister said

31
00:01:49,022 --> 00:01:52,274
I'm a piece of shit for insulting my wife's looks.

32
00:01:52,694 --> 00:01:55,918
Her friends all think I'm the asshole. I tried

33
00:01:55,966 --> 00:02:00,486
not to say anything. I can't force myself to find her attractive.

34
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,590
I still love her, but her face is just weird now. She looks

35
00:02:04,622 --> 00:02:06,654
like the blue alien from the fifth element.
