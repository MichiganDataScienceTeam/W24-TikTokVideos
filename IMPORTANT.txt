Create a virtual environment in your folder with python3 -m venv env
Activate the virtual environment with source env/bin/activate. 
You need to activate the virtual environment every time you come back to work on the tutorials! 
If this is done correctly, you should see (env) at the left end of your terminal.

$ python3 -m venv env 
$ source env/bin/activate

When you are done working for the day, you can deactivate the virtual environment by running deactivate in the terminal. 

$ deactivate

To open Jupyter Notebook, run jupyter notebook in the terminal:
